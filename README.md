# Collecting-Email-Addresses-From-Google-Maps

## Introduction

Welcome to the project to collect business contact information! This project aims to collect email addresses and Instagram paths, for various type of businesses. Email lists are useful for marketing, networking, collaboration, customer service, and research. They allow businesses and organizations to communicate with their audience and achieve their goals.

The project is divided into two parts: **Google Maps Webscraping** and **Contact Information Searching**.

## [Part A: Google Maps Webscraping](https://github.com/Johneration/Collecting-Email-Addresses-From-Google-Maps/blob/main/collect_email_addresses_from_google_maps.ipynb)

> The first part of the project involves scraping store information from Google Maps. We will be using a web scraping tool to extract data such as the store's name, address, star rating, number of reviews, and most importantly, websites. This information will be stored in a Pandas DataFrame for later use. Once we have collected all of the relevant data, we will proceed to the second part of the project.

## [Part B: Contact Information Searching](https://github.com/Johneration/Collecting-Email-Addresses-From-Google-Maps/blob/main/collect_email_addresses_from_google_maps.ipynb)

> The second part of the project involves visiting each of the websites we have scraped in the first part and searching for email addresses and Instagram paths. Once we have located the email addresses and Instagram paths, we will store them in the DataFrame along with the other information we have collected. This will allow us to have a comprehensive list of contact information.

This script has a wide range of applications. You can search for any type of business in any location, and specify how many stores to return. This makes it a versatile tool for tasks such as building a database of contact information or gathering data for market research.
